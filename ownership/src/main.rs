/*

This program illustrates how Rust handles objects and copies of them 
in the context of a specific scope. When we use these objects in a specific scope as "String::from"
we initialize an object in scope, and when this is passed to a function, the object stops being available
within the scope.

However, this is not the case with x, because we're initializing this directly
When passing x to a function we realize that it is copied and passed on.alloc

The string s is not available after we pass it to a function within the original scope. 
But the int x is available for other operations after being passed to makes_copy() 

Output:

hello
5  // this is produced by the function makes_copy()
5  // this is produced by the println! macro


When we use clone() on a variable, we make a copy of it and make it available 
for use without losing ownership
